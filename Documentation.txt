  (int) isReadable(char*path)
Purspose of the function :
Checking if the file specified by (char*)path exists, so as to read from the file.

How:
Creates a file pointer (FILE*)file and opens the file specified with (char*)path in reading mode. Then, checks whether (FILE*)file == NULL.

When:
This function is automatically called anytime another function, which does reading, is called.

Return Values :
(FILE*)file == NULL => Returns 0
(FILE*)file != NULL => Returns 1
-----------------------
  (int) countLines(char*path)
Purpose of the function : 
Counts how many lines the file, which is specified by the (char*)path.

How :
Initialises a variable which stores the number of line with the value of 1. From the start of the file, starts reading every character. When the character read is a line
feed (ascii 10), adds 1 to the variable which stores the number of lines. Continues until the end of file is reached.

When:

Return Values : 
isReadable(path) => Number of lines
!isReadable(path) => 0 -> Error code for cases which the file is not readable
